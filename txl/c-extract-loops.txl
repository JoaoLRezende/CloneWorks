% Extract loop constructs from source files.
% Based on c-extract-functions.txl.

% TODO: Cause this program to format its output appropriately, with
% XML-style markup, as is done by c-extract-functions.txl. Also look at
% the older versions of this file (also in this directory) for inspiration.
% After making sure you've reutilized every useful part of the older versions
% of this program in this directory, delete them. (Make sure to
% either deal with or copy the TODOs contained in them, too.)

% TODO: the markup generated by this program reports that nearly every fragment
% ends one line later than it actually ends. This is most likely because,
% in the definition of loop, the second occurence of [srclinenumber]
% captures the line number of the token that comes after it, rather
% than of the preceding occurence of [loop_statement].
% See how c-extract-functions.txl deals with this: the final [srclinenumber]
% appears right before the block's closing curly brace. This causes
% the line number of the closing curly brace itself to be captured, rather
% than the line number of what comes after it.
% Change this program accordingly.
% In doing that, it might be useful to recycle some definitions from the old
% c-extract-loops.txl.old2: for_statement_header, while_statement_header,
% do_statement_header, loop_header. After doing this, delete that file.

% TODO: Comment this program properly.

% Using Gnu C grammar
